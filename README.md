## Design

## Service microservice

I created 3 models, one for making/tracking appointments, tracking technicians and and veiwing inventory using a VO. When creating an appointment, the views checks to see if the appointment VIN is matching with the inventoryVO VIN. If it is, it stores as true and will display an VIP icon on the appointments page. Otherwise it stores VIP as false and displays nothing under the VIP tab.

## Sales microservice

Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here.
